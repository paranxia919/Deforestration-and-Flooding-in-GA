The initial severe storms produced tornadoes in Logan County and in Stutsman County. Both tornadoes touched down in open fields and impacted no structures. Both were rated EFU (Unknown) by National Weather Service policy as there was no damage to evaluate. Hail then became the main threat with the largest hail of two inches in diameter falling near Woodworth. Later in the event strong thunderstorm winds and torrential rain became the main threats over the James River Valley.  The city of Jamestown was hit by hail, high winds and three to five inches of rain, causing flash flooding. There was also flooding along Interstate 94 west of Jamestown, in Stutsman County. In Jamestown, streets and parking lots were flooded with several feet of water, stranding motorists. In and around the city of Marion, thunderstorm wind gusts estimated at 90 mph caused damage to the local elevator, dislodged two large grain bins, and caused home and tree damage.",

This as an upper level short wave trough approached the area and a frontal boundary moved in from Montana. The first storm to develop was over Dunn County and quickly produced a tornado. The tornado occurred over an open field south of Manning and impacted no structures. There was no damage to evaluate, therefore it was rated EF-U (Unknown) by NWS policy. Thereafter, the main threat with the thunderstorms was large hail. The largest reported hail was the size of a baseball, and also occurred in Dunn County. There were also reports of severe wind gusts, particularly towards the end of the event with the later storms. With that said, the strongest wind gust did occur during the middle of the event near Plaza, Mountrail County, where estimated 75 mph wind gusts cause tree damage.",

         "A powerful storm system digging through the four corners provided widespread precipitation across the southern High Plains on the tenth and 11th. Initially, spotty light rain affected the region on the morning of the tenth and early afternoon as a disturbance ahead of the primary storm system emerged over the region. A good portion of the South Plains did see sunshine and mild temperatures during the afternoon, but that quickly changed that night as colder air moved in behind a backdoor cold front. Immediately in advance of the colder air, a broken line of non-severe thunderstorms formed over the southern Rolling Plains but quickly shifted off to the east. Behind the cold front temperatures dipped into the lower 30s and upper 20s during the early morning hours of the 11th just as precipitation expanded in coverage and intensity. The rain changed to snow from northwest to southeast across the South Plains and Rolling Plains as the colder air moved in. The exception was across the far southern Rolling Plains, around Stonewall and Kent Counties, where temperatures remained mild enough to keep the precipitation a cold rain. The snow, heavy at times, continued through much of the day for the South Plains, southern Texas Panhandle, and northern and central Rolling Plains, before finally diminishing from west to east in the evening as the upper level system shifted off into Oklahoma and North Texas. The heaviest snow was concentrated across the northern South Plains and south-central Texas Panhandle where totals in excess of six inches were common.||Snowfall reports from NWS cooperative weather observers are listed below:||12.0 inches at Plainview (Hale County),|11.0 inches at Olton (Lamb County),|10.0 inches at Vigo Park (Swisher County),|10.0 inches at Turkey (Hall County),|9.4 inches at Abernathy (Hale County),|8.7 inches at Floydada (Floyd County),|8.5 inches at Hart (Castro County),|7.5 inches at Flomot 2E (Motley County),|7.0 inches at Dimmitt (Castro County),|6.0 inches at Littlefield 5SE (Lamb County),|6.0 inches at Silverton (Briscoe County),|6.0 inches at Roaring Springs (Motley County),|5.7 inches at Shallowater (Lubbock County),|5.7 inches at Reese 4E (Lubbock County),|5.5 inches at Ropesville 6NNW (Hockley County),|5.0 inches at Tulia (Swisher County),|5.0 inches at Muleshoe Wildlife Refuge (Bailey County),|5.0 inches at Matador (Motley County),|5.0 inches at Northfield (Motley County),|5.0 inches at Paducah 10S (Cottle County),|5.0 inches at Floydada 9SE (Floyd County),|4.5 inches at Muleshoe (Bailey County),|4.0 inches at Childress (Childress County),|4.0 inches at Tell 3S (Childress County),|4.0 inches at Woodrow 3W (Lubbock County),|3.6 inches at Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport (Lubbock County),|3.3 inches at Morton (Cochran County),|3.2 inches at Levelland (Hockley County),|3.1 inches at Dumont (King County),|3.0 inches at Paducah 7E (Cottle County),|3.0 inches at Friona (Parmer County),|2.5 inches at Kirkland 1W (Childress County),|2.5 inches at Dodson 5S (Childress County),|2.3 inches at Childress 7NW (Childress County),|2.0 inches at Slaton (Lubbock County),|2.0 inches at Crosbyton (Crosby County),|2.0 inches at Memphis (Hall County),|1.8 inches at Southland (Garza County),|1.5 inches at Brownfield (Terry County), and|1.0 inch at Tahoka (Lynn County).",

         "A quick-moving, but potent disturbance moving across southern New Mexico and Far West Texas brought strong lift and enough moisture to generate widespread precipitation. Initially, the lower atmosphere was quite dry, but as it moistened from cloud level downward, the precipitation did make it all the way to the surface. Temperatures were cool enough in the extreme southwestern Texas Panhandle to see accumulating snowfall. ||Snowfall reports from NWS cooperative weather observers are listed below:||3.0 inches at Friona (Parmer County),|2.8 inches at Farwell (Parmer County),|2.5 inches at Muleshoe (Bailey County),|1.8 inches at Olton (Lamb County),|1.5 inches at Dimmitt (Castro County),|1.0 inch at Earth (Lamb County), and|1.0 inch at Hart (Castro County).",
